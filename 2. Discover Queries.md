## Discover Queries

![](img/analytics.png)

Going one step further than the drag and drop visuals, we can also get an initial look at our using the KQL language to run some quick searches. We will take a look at the next tool under the Analytics umbrella, Discover.

Let's try it out with an easy exampe: 

```
gryffindor
```
![](img/5%20hits.png)

This only gives us 5 hits. That doesn't seem consistent with the previous Dashboard view, we know we have a "House" field that's mostly dommuniated by red and gold. 

Take a closer look at those 5 hits. It seems they are all part of text fields rather than the pie-chart values we looked at earlier. This is our first encounter with a very important property: case sensitivity. 

```
Gryffindor
```

Searching for "Gryffindor" instead gives us 38 hits. You can notice in the result we are now getting results both in the "House" column, as well as the text fields from the previous query. Odd, right?

The reason for this is that fields such as "Job" and "Skills" have been processed as "text" fields - which are then automatically analyzed by Elastic and lowercased to make searching them easier. While, on the other side, the field "House" has been mapped as a "keyword", which remains case sensitive for more precise queries. 

It's therefore useful to be more prescriptive with what we are searchign for. 
We can specify we want to find the entries with "House: Gryffindor"; or those who have Gryffindor in their skills:

```
Skills: Gryffindor
```

In the next sections, we'll finally dive in and look at some core Elasticsearch concepts. Let's clear up "text" from "keyword" and explore our complex fields a little better to run some fun queries.
